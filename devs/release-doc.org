* version is set below with bumpversion
* install with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
* development testing
** start clean
make clean
** check code with fake8:
make lint
** run tests with default python:
make test
** run tests with all support python versions:
make test-all
- make sure tox.ini is in sync with minimum versiono claimed in setup.py
- This does not work well with conda, since it can have only one version in a
  environment. Create a environment for the minimum in needed with:
  - conda create -n py310 python=3.10
    conda activate py310
    conda install tox
** test install from local dist:
make test-pip
** build and check docs:
  make docs
on Mac OS/X
  make docs-open
** check test coverage:
make coverage
** push to github
** test on MacOS, other Linux dists
** rebuild master at readthedocs to check for errors

* test pip with testpypi
** Update the version in code, but don't change git.  Version number needed for testing pip, however this might result in changes
bumpversion --allow-dirty --no-commit --no-tag [major|minor|patch]
** make test
** testing pip install using pypitest.  Must bump version for retesting:
make release-testpypi
** test release install from pypitest in virtualenv
make test-release-testpypi

* Release process:
** do all of the above testing
** WARNING: may have to update git tag if any things fixed
** update HISTORY.rst
